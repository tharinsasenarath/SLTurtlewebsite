            <div class="para_box">
                <p> In Sri Lanka, there is a well-known turtle conservation initiative called the Bentota 
                    Turtle Hatchery. It is located in the well-known tourist attraction of Bentota, which
                     is a town on Sri Lanka's southwest coast.  As sea turtles face numerous risks in the wild,
                      such as predation, pollution, habitat degradation, and illegal poaching, the main objective
                       of the hatchery is to raise the survival rate of sea turtles. The effort is crucial
                        in educating the public about the need to protect these threatened species.                 
                     <br><br>
                     Learn about the several sea turtle species that may be found in Sri Lanka at the Bentota
                      Turtle Hatchery, including the Green Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Olive
                       Ridley Turtle, and Leatherback Turtle. In order to safeguard sea turtles from
                        both natural and human dangers, the hatchery harvests eggs from shoreline nesting
                         areas that are particularly susceptible. The young turtles are nurtured once they
                          hatch until they are a specific size and strength before being released into the ocean.
                     Visitors to the hatchery can also take part in the release of baby turtles into the ocean. 
                     People can participate in conservation efforts and see the turtles return to their natural
                      environment through this practical experience.<br>
                      
                      In addition to its conservation efforts, the Bentota Turtle Hatchery frequently works with 
                      nearby towns, schools, and organisations to spread the word about the value of preserving 
                      the maritime environment and sea turtle protection. Although the Bentota Turtle Hatchery
                       is a well-liked tourist destination, there have been some questions raised about the
                        procedures and working conditions at several turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka. It's always 
                        a good idea to do some research and pick trustworthy businesses that put the welfare and
                         conservation of sea turtles first.

        <h1>A Look into the Bentota Turtle Hatchery</h1>
        <p>Everyone who comes to Bentota enjoys visiting the Bentota Turtle Hatchery Project. 
            The picturesque golden sands that entice you to our island also offer numerous endangered turtle species,
             such as the Olive Ridley and Leatherback turtles, an alluring nesting site. The project's objective is to preserve 
             and safeguard the eggs against predators and other threats. To find out more about these beautiful and 
             endangered sea creatures, go to the turtle hatchery in Bentota.

              Until the eggs hatch and are prepared to swim back home, the turtle hatchery guards the eggs.
              The group also saves sea turtles who sustain injuries from fishing nets, motors, and other sources while at sea.
               Before being released back, they are frequently rehabbed.</p>

             <h1> Important details concerning the Bentota Turtle Hatchery</h1>

        <div class="list">
            <br>
            <li>Conservation Efforts:The Olive Ridley, Green, Loggerhead, Hawksbill, and Leatherback turtles,
                 among other species of sea turtles, are among those whose conservation is greatly aided by 
                 the hatchery. Its main objectives are the gathering and safeguarding of sea turtle eggs, their
                  controlled hatching, and the safe release of the hatchlings into the ocean.</li>
                <br>

            <li>Turtle Rehabilitation: The hatchery offers a sanctuary for sea turtles that have been hurt or
                 are otherwise unable to survive. Until they are ready to be released back into the wild, these turtles get care 
                 and rehabilitation at the facility.
            </li>
                <br>

            <li>Visitor Experience: Visitors who are interested in learning more about sea turtles and conservation are 
                welcome at the Bentota Turtle Hatchery. Visitors can witness the eggs in the hatchery, watch the newborn 
                turtles being released into the sea, and interact with the resident turtles at the centre to observe the various
                 stages of the turtle breeding process.</li> 
                   <br>  
                   
            <li> Educational Programs:To raise awareness of turtle protection among residents and visitors, the hatchery runs 
                educational programmes and initiatives. They stress how crucial it is to safeguard sea turtles and their habitats, 
                lessen pollution, and implement sustainable practises. </li> 
                    <br>  

            <li> Donations and Volunteering: To sustain its conservation activities, the Bentota Turtle Hatchery is dependent
                 on donations and the help of volunteers. Visitors can help by giving money or giving up their time to help with
                  various tasks at the hatchery. </li> 
                   <br>  
        </div>

        <p>While the hatchery is a well-liked tourist destination, there has been some discussion and criticism over particular
             elements of sea turtle conservation facilities in Sri Lanka. Some contend that some turtle hatcheries put tourism 
             before conservation and might even use methods that aren't fully good for the turtles. If you're interested in aiding
              Sri Lanka's attempts to conserve sea turtles, it's a good idea to do some research and pick trustworthy conservation
               organisations.</p>
