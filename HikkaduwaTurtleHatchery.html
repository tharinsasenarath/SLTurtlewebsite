                <h1>Hikkaduwa Hatchery</h1>

            <div class="para_box">
                    <p class="main_para"> On Sri Lanka's southwest coast, Hikkaduwa is well-known for its 
                        stunning beaches and an abundance of marine life, including sea turtles. One of the best locations 
                        to see turtles in Sri Lanka is Turtle Beach the well-known tourist destination of Hikkaduwa.
                         At Hikkaduwa Turtle Beach, tourists 
                        have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to collect a little weed that has washed up on the shore. 
                        The turtle hatchery cares for injured turtles and provides a safe haven for their eggs. <br><br>
                       When the eggs are ready to hatch and be released back into the big blue, they are gathered
                        and kept at the hatchery's facilities. Tourists may witness turtle embryos that have been 
                        safely buried in the sand hatchery. After two days, eggs usually start to hatch. Turtles are
                         handled extremely gently to ensure appropriate development and eventual safe release into 
                         the water. There is a turtle farm in Hikkaduwa where visitors may see the turtles,
                          get up close and personal with them, and discover a lot about these magnificent animals.
