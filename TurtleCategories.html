                            land tortoises and marine turtles. These magnificent creatures are an important part of the island's marine ecosystem and are
                             protected by conservation efforts. It's important to note that all sea turtle species are protected by law in 
                             Sri Lanka, and efforts are made to conserve their nesting sites and habitats.<br><br>
                            Among the five turtle species found in the Sri Lankan Ocean, three are endangered, one is vulnerable and one is critically endangered.
